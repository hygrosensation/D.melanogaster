#Analyis FCA_10x Data
#Quality control

FCA_10x[["percent.mt"]] <- PercentageFeatureSet(pbmc, pattern = "^MT-")
FCA_10x <- subset(FCA_10x, subset = nFeature_RNA > 200 & nFeature_RNA < 2500 & percent.mt < 5)

#Normalisation
pbmc <- NormalizeData(pbmc, normalization.method = "LogNormalize", scale.factor = 10000)r = 10000)

#Find Variable Features
FCA_10x <- FindVariableFeatures(FCA_10x, selection.method = "vst", nfeatures = 2000)

##The default is to use the variable features, which could be recommended for most cases

#Scaling the data
all.genes <- rownames(FCA_10x)
FCA_10x <- ScaleData(FCA_10x, features = all.genes)

#Perform PCA
FCA_10x <- RunPCA(FCA_10x, features = VariableFeatures(object = FCA_10x))

## Could be good to add more PC-components to capture more variation

#Clustering
FCA_10x <- FindNeighbors(FCA_10x, dims = 1:40)
FCA_10x <- FindClusters(FCA_10x, resolution = 0.5)
